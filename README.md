# ULAB Course Repository 2025-2026

Welcome all! For the last couple of weeks of Python instruction, we will be using this repository to gain familiarity with Git procedures. You will find all of the materials 
for Homework #3 under the hw3 folder, and updates will be made for the subsequent homeworks. Clone this repository to your local machine to get all of the materials, then copy 
into your own repository for submission. Happy coding!
